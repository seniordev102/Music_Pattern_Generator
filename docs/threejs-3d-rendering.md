# Three.js 3D rendering

## Line width

### Line

The regular Line object can only render lines of 1px tickness.

### Line2 / LineSegments2

Line2 / LineSegments2 by WestLangley, http://github.com/WestLangley supports variable line width.

Resources:

- Added linewidth support: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/11349
- https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/objects/LineSegments

### MeshLine

THREE.MeshLine, https://github.com/spite/THREE.MeshLine, is another possibility.
I haven't tried it yet.
